family noted reached top professionsthe intention article discus preventive aspect diabetic heart disease dhd hopefully may prevent least death common saying go within every patient diabetes enemy heart disease hiding problem may worsen future country sri lanka incidence diabetes rising rapidly contrast developed country usa despite rise incidence diabetes death rate decreasing could attributed several factor availability modern treatment technique well knowledge patent posse dhd even sri lanka facility available living major city colombo state private sector state sector kandy jaffna kurunegala heart attack heart attack occurs blood supply heart suddenly blocked formation blood clot blood vessel coronary artery consisting cholesterol depositsthe clot formed platelet clotting

extensive disease regardless whether live motherland elsewhere premature death occur patient young unless individual treated properly succumb first attack largely additional coronary vessesl given u nature called collateral opened vessel open even clot blood could diverted vessel preventing death heart muscle contrast quite rarely elderly person dy first attack given patient age sufficient time collateral open factor contributing formation cholesterol deposit diabetes contrary popular belief raised blood sugar alone contributes process fact important cause indicated order importance

attack since blood pressure cholesterol well control opposite occurs control sugar level attend two contributory factor recently shown certain infection gum periodontitis could contributing factor condition really precipitate heart attack discussed cause deposition cholesterol coronary blood vessel factor really precipitate attack largely unknownwhat known least little time day nearly attack occur early hour morning say reason sudden surge hormone cortisol adrenaline adrenaline level could also rise time day mental physical stress exercise induced heart attack could low blood sugar hypoglycaemia precipitate heart attack answer certainly yes author documented several case blood sugar drop whatever reason like due prolonged starvation excessive use anti diabetic drug physical exercise hormone come play sometimes patient die night sleep since tendency blood sugar drop since dont consume food period heart attack silent patient feel pain thus mandatory u enquire patient whether symptom low blood sugar excessive hunger sweating dizziness palpitation onset attack therefore advisable diabetic patient routinely consume night time snack prevent low blood sugar night symptom sign heart attack commonest symptom course chest pain felt behind chest bone throat even back also could come sudden loss consciousness difficulty breathing palpitation experienced physician could even diagnose heart attack way patient show chest pain isthis called body language sign detected medical officer include shock blood pressure low pulse impalpable low high pulse rate sign acute heart failure atypical presentation diabetic heart attack fainting attack may even go unnoticed patient doctor gastritis label carry certain kind danger many life lost due low attention paid symptom patient complain chest pain front chest like heart attack named called attribution error condition patient time doctor attribute consumption hot meal another type spicy food silent heart attack discussed one pain estimated nearly diabetic patient would manifest silent heart attacksthis raise importance identifying patient proper screening method would discussed later also stated sometimes heart attack could develop gradually symptom discussed may come slowly say example chest pain come exertion called angina emergency treatment suspected heart attack emergency treatment carried home sooner patient develops chest pain single dose aspirin mg immediately administered study shown early treatment using aspirin would effective administering clot busting medication streptokinase another type emergency treatment could administered home cocktail following drug aaspirin mg indicated ba drug called clopidogrel mg c atorvastain cholesterol lowering drug dose mg dpantaprazole acid lowering drug could prevent occurrence gastritis caused high dose aspirin certain country available heart pack could certainly introduced sri lankan home test suspected heart attack ecg would useful case

national hospital sri lanka colombo feed vital knowledge regarding high blood pressure according dr gunathilake research conducted country estimate statistically sixseven every ten sri lankans would suffering high blood pressure condition highly prevalent country number suffering hypertension likely increase time due increasing incidence risk factor contribute development high blood pressure heart pump blood throughout body contracting relaxing blood carried part body blood vessel functional status heart amount pressure applied wall blood vessel termed person blood pressure average normal blood pressure healthy adult considered mmhg kind hypertension suffer dr gunathilake stated high blood pressure mainly two type wall blood vessel get progressively thicker due various reason age contributes gradual elevation blood pressure thickening attributed multifactorial ageing component include high cholesterol level person dietary habit therefore everyone victim experiencing elevated blood pressure age form hypertension known essential hypertension form high blood pressure secondary hypertension occurs secondarily consequence due main complication kidney problem tumour body especially adrenal well medication certain disease elevate blood pressure important note obesity high lipid level body ischaemic heart disease diabetes major risk factor mentioned dr gunathilake hypertension risk factor considering cause hypertension age definitely causative factor age blood pressure gradually increase previously mentioned due fact thickness wall blood vessel increase resulting rise pressure list causative factor hypertension also includes risk factor might consequently cause hypertension important note obesity high lipid level body ischaemic heart disease diabetes major risk factor contribute hypertension among others sedentary lifestyle smoking stress inferred mentioned unlike hypertension low blood pressure occurs secondarily various physiological condition cardiac shock dehydration low blood pressure disease entity sign diagnosis treatment occasion hypertension display symptom often detected blood pressure checked case high blood pressure symptom like dizziness blurred vision severe headache experienced however dr gunathilake warned symptom appear later stagesthe diagnosis high blood pressure condition done checking blood pressure important ensure

asthma result allergy airway carry air nostril lung affected allergic condition result inflammation swelling inner region airway tube consequently cavity airway tube narrow secretion airway tract reduce volume airway tract smooth flow air obstructed thereby causing difficulty breathing course lead dire consequence condition negligently ignored health capsule spoke dr pradeep kumarasinghe consultant physician colombo national hospital shed light topic honour world asthma day asthma common condition attributed various reason could trigger allergic condition inflammatory response increasingly worsening kevels environmental pollution various infection exposure cold worsen allergic condition lead asthma said dr kumarasinghe continued saying asthma many degree milder version condition well severe one could even fatal milder degree asthma common form asthma dangerous however severe form asthma fatal treated therefore important identify treat condition accordingly mentioned sign symptom first symptom wheeze people might generally tend refer asthma wheeze however wheezing symptom asthma condition indicated wheezing occurs air flow narrowed airway tube produce wheezing sound wheezing often indicates mild nonsevere form asthma however severe case disease wheezing sound produced tube becomes exceedingly narrow air able flow airway consultant physician warned indicates silent asthma critically severe condition due allergic condition inner layer airway tube become swollen secretion respiratory tract get accumulated accumulation fluid lead phlegm accompanied longstanding cough night coughing main symptom asthma difficulty breathing course another symptom asthma asthmatic attack get severe patient may experience symptom pain neck muscle discomfort breathing tube stethoscope able detect wheezing sound eye tongue might become blue due lack oxygen transported due difficulty breathing symptom severe form asthma stated patient suffers mild case asthma patient would short breath able complete talking sentence condition severe however patient cant speak without panting short breath indicates patient might suffering severe asthma immediately taken hospital could get fatal left untreated wheezing often indicates mild nonsevere form asthma however severe case disease wheezing sound produced many myth revolve around use inhaler explicated people falsely believe inhaler get addictive inhaler treatment since problem asthma lie respiratory airway treatment address airway asthma treated drug inhaler important device come treatment asthma inhaler provides effective method delivering drug directly required target location case respiratory airway drug would aid expanding narrowed airway dispelling difficulty breathe dr kumarasinghe explained many myth revolve around use inhaler explicated people falsely believe inhaler get addictive true fact inhaler cut dosage drug one tenth used tablet course inhaler would used routinely person persistent asthma patient high dos drug asthma treatment could cause raise heartbeat shivering amidst effect using inhaler minimizes effect implied inhaler particularly important used routinely severe form asthma patient experience difficulty breathing hence case asthmatic attack mild use inhaler prescribed inhaler could either reliever preventers reliever used relieve symptom asthma patient inflicted however case patient repeatedly succumbs asthmatic attack preventer used addition reliever prevent occurrence another asthmatic attack therefore patient persistent asthma prescribed use preventer twice day irrespective fact whether currently suffering asthma patient get infrequent asthma attack medication may limited use reliever need preventer dr kumarasinghe elaborated asthma may also caused due infection upper respiratory tract case treatment would address infection treated well case allergic attack steroid tablet given day case acute asthma steroid medication prolonged dosage gradually reduced ended produce side effect however steroid medication prescribed day patient danger experiencing side effect said patient suffer asthma severely subjected nebulization performs function inhaler drug delivered airway forceful effective manner case life threatening asthma patient would find difficult talk one breath talking breathing would challenge patient patient would admitted hospital preventive precaution order prevent asthma important prevent cold exposure exposure condition may trigger allergy habit like smoking asthma commonly seen child allergy may triggered due house dust pet eczema manifestation allergy may also indicate asthma therefore important maintain environment free dust provide proper ventilation minimize exposure factor trigger allergy mentioned dr kumarasinghe proper use inhaler adopts specific technique pharmacist demonstrate use inhaler however spite using inhaler patient show improvement recovery may patient adopts improper technique administering inhaler therefore patient consult physician technique using inhaler important wash mouth advised according consultant physician use inhaler best method treating preventing asthmatic attack,health

vision important every sense organ body due age lifestyle change vision could get weaker time study done uncorrected refractive error wereknown common cause distance vision impairment affecting million person globally also secondmost cause blindness globally predicted global population affected myopia sri lanka also common problem islandwide survey done people year age prevalence apart cataract mind mirror health capsule spoke prof madhuwanthi dissanayake professor consultant eye surgeon faculty medicine university colombo spoke myopia detail myopia according prof dissanayake myopia also called nearsightedness one refractive error image formedinside eye clear myopia image form front retina resultsfrom either eye ball large due condensing power cornea lens high two axial length length eyeball longer common cause child young adult later lens get affectedby age due toconditions cataract lens protein change lens powerwill increase known index myopia happens advancing age refractive error clear image formed retina include farsightedness hypermetropia astigmatism nearsightedness clear faraway object myopia greater dioptresis called high myopia high myopiacan associated problem retinal degeneration retinal detachment glaucoma lens different position systemic illness thereforehigh myopic child also checked disease marfan syndrome also child systemic disease down syndrome referred eye check therefore important pay special attention people high myopia andif get symptom floater flashing light retina checked prevent sudden vision loss symptom blurring image distant object appear blurred myopia therefore people myopiacannot recognize face crowd social interaction poor sri lanka get number reference teacher child difficulty school work first noticed vigilant teacher headache seated back child try look harder focus time eye muscle get tired get headache eye fatigue initially try focus time give way point cant see anything squinting see people partially closing eye bright area sometimes see child narrowing eye closing eye partially help cut peripheral ray make see better light ray passing central part pupil making vision clearer temporary child moving closer tv student moving front row class see whats written board diagnosis diagnosis done ophthalmologist doctorsspecializing eye optometrist person trained checking vision determining spectacle state sector private sector hospital continued associated systemic problem therefore initial consultation could done doctor followed optometrist sometimes diagnosis done putting eye drop dilate pupil check full refractive error situation doctor prescription needed occurs child therefore first need visit doctor diagnosis need make sure child wear spectacle time except bathing sleeping otherwise necessary effect thereafter rechecking glass refraction checked every month child year within dioptre within year changed change gross better checked doctor normally height child axial length eye ball also increase happens rapidly year year stabilize parent worried child vision failing read last line chart spectacle normal get weakerhas checked special treatment may needed treatment spectacle one option use conclave lens myopia open ray thereby allowing image form away right retina added image form behind retina use convex lens get image towards u retina nowadays technically advanced material slightest change thickness make higher power difference also known high index lens refractive index material tell much power generate nowadays people high myopia use normal glass material technologically advanced contact lens another option whichcould used even small child problem infection change corneal surface etcthe cornea get oxygen supply outside since blood vessel taking oxygen cornea need exposed gas permeable contact lens therefore contact lens removed night used properly cornea get swollen prone infection adult another optionlasersurgery year carve necessary curvature cornea removing normal tissue cornea one problem laser surgery removing normal tissue reshape cornea irreversible procedurethere minimum thicknessafter surgery refractive error limit corneal thickness certain thickness otherwise break bifocal glass child new option well pharmacological method eye drop method try limit progression myopia moment used child show rapid progression lifestyle change could help prof dissanayake said prevalence myopia increase due lifestyle pattern time spent outdoors childhood may reduce progression myopia child adolescent play outside endorphin created body reduce progression myopia back day one period physical education nowadays teacher take period teach subject need make compulsory physical education school need play outside sunlight result distance vision mechanism come play factor vitamin allows bone act collagen work although living tropical country using given free u see child taking vitamin supplement therefore need utilize resource child also need engage playtime activity order stimulate brain endorphin activity increase environment created need healthier generation there high chance myopia progressing change dont happen concluding remark prof dissanayake said since child read number letter time grade one parent take moh clinic hospital optometrist get eyesight checked special clinic also available lady ridgeway

apple injected lot marketing hyperbole claim wonder bit computing showed processor heart new iphone real longterm reason apple smart move beyond bit era mobile computing iphone maker indeed beat smartphone rival bit era processor may indeed vault predecessor performance hyperbole came apple marketing chief phil schiller speaking apple iphone c launch event tuesday linked two accomplishment go schiller asked referring new chip bit version io apple io apps benefit huge twice fast previousgeneration system cpu task schiller said twice fast graphic task there reason computer industry shifting bit computing main benefit memory capacity exceed gb saw bit personal computer arriving last decade bit design dont automatically improve performance task fact drawback likely bit version program bulkier bit equivalent apple smart lay foundation bit mobile computing three reason first large memory capacity academic issue mobile market today wont always second bit transition happens come along chip change useful immediately third give apple flexibility build armbased pc chooses embrace alternative intel chip bit computing bit chip handle memory address described bit number rather bit one mean computer accommodate gb memory chip math integer lot bigger bit transition doesnt effect lot computing performance server bit chip crucial machine often need gob memory running many task simultaneously keeping much possible fastresponse ram pc bit chip useful avoid bumping gb memory limit mainstream market today mobile device though gb limit yet arrive even though ram really useful got big drawback mobile market expensive take room problematic draw lot electrical power therefore shortens battery life samsung galaxy note android phone unusually large gb ram also got unusually large size handle biggerthanaverage mah battery better bit math helpful task like scientific simulation big deal mobile apple event epic game executive gleeful performance playing infinity blade there reason doubt statement could draw dragon four time detail performance improvement likely come new graphic ability support richer opengl e graphicsacceleration interface bit design bother bit mobile chip even bit computing isnt acrosstheboard speedup technology there good reason adopt future splash little cold water schiller enthusiasm pc world went transition bit bit took year schiller said today youre going see apple going move mobile computing system forward bit bit one day sure took couple hour apple announce iphone processor full bit transition take year mobile pc market indeed transition already going couple year four year behindcloseddoors work arm holding announced bit armv instruction set chip design license apple qualcomm samsung many maker mobile chip apple us armv architecture hardware change first part come software apple retooled io kernel heart software library prewritten code software draw upon device driver kernel us talk hardware like network touch screen bit software got version xcode developer tool programmer build bit version io product itll year whole software ecosystem make move old software likely never make change good armv chip run older bit software seamlessly programmer still need build bit version software older iphones well brandnew bit model like iphone c given long take make transition important lay hardware foundation early enough software market move gracefully even though adding ram hard mobile device itll happen might well happen sooner ipads handle faster processor bigger battery elaborate software possible computing engineer successfully commercialize form memory thats powerhungry armv benefit nearerterm reason apple might appeal programmer nothing bit nature armv architecture brings real advantage one larger number register tiny onchip storage area processor store data fast access armv roughly double generalpurpose register mean chip neednt fritter away many cycle swapping thing memory amd pioneered bit computing x transition pushed intel distracted itanium design got big speed boost increasing number register bit x chip hobbled four register bit arm chip relatively abundant could mean performance boost wont good arm transition armv also significant change got much better mathematical ability especially performing operation lot data got builtin encryption processing ability speed lot secure communication cut battery usage new apple option apple surprised world moved mac line powerpc processor intel processor rumbling might move least embrace arm chip mac processor rumored higherend ax sibling might enough oomph fullfledged personal computer hard miss schiller boasting desktopclass architecture even there never armbased mac still possible apple could take io something laptoplike company made iwork free new io device threw iphoto imovie bargain clearly like idea customer creating content io device consuming apple chose build armbased pc gb memory could useful thus would big asset mature bit arm chip design accompanying operating system app collection armbased apple pc would dramatic shift indeed intel working furiously lowering power consumption x chip compete better arm armbased apple pc would serious difficulty running mac software xbased machine need invent reason schiller bit enthusiasm besides make good marketing line something sound like progress thats easy see
